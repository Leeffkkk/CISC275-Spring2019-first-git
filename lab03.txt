For this assignment you will be using version control, which is necessary to work effectively in a team.



"What is version control, and/or what is Git?" Read: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control (Links to an external site.) 



For this assignment you will follow the instructions at the above link to: 
- Set up git on your machine (https://git-scm.com) See Chapter 1 of the linked text.


- Establish a directory to play in, and initialize it. Having a play space is very important. When you aren't sure exactly what something does in git, you can go to your play directory and test things there.


- Read Chapter 2. Play with add, commit, status, diff, diff --staged, reset, log.


- In your play directory, create four files. Make is so that: one is untracked; one is modified; one is staged; one is in the repo. Verify the state of your four files and ask another person to confirm you have those four files in four states.



In this space, type the sequence of commands you used to achieve the final state of all four files:






	{
	create repo.txt
	git add repo.txt
	git commit -m "commit only repo.txt"
	
	create untracked.txt
	
	create modified.txt
	git add modified.txt
	edit & save modified.txt
	
	create staged.txt
	git add staged.txt
	}
